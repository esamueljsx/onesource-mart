        It all started with a simple idea, to make shopping easier, friendlier,
        and closer to home. Back in 2015, a small team of passionate people
        noticed how stressful grocery shopping could be in their community.
        Prices weren’t clear, quality wasn’t consistent, and convenience was
        rare.So they decided to build something better, OneSource Supermarket.{" "}
        <br />A place where customers could get everything they need from one
        source.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        Today, we remain committed to our roots while embracing modern practices
        that benefit our customers and the environment.
